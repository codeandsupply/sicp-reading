## My comment

This was 1984.

In 1991, I dropped out of grad school in physics and had no plan for
my life. I was going to apply for a job as an actuary, but then
suddenly decided that I would be bored out of my mind in that
profession. Friends suggested that I go into computer programming, but
I had been too scared to take intro computer science in college, and
therefore did not write a single line of code in college and all I
knew was some BASIC, COBOL, and Pascal programming from high
school. Friends said there were jobs if you knew C and UNIX (two
things that had scared me away from freshman computer science!). One
friend, who graduated from MIT in EECS, told me I should learn
computer science for real first, by studying the textbook SICP he used
as a freshman at MIT, which used a much friendlier language called
Scheme in order to teach concepts.

So I bought a copy of SICP and self-studied it and loved it. I bought
a used Macintosh SE/30 (since my Apple IIe I used throughout college
just for word processing was underpowered by 1991), and although
frustrated I could not get MIT Scheme for it, I found a nice Scheme
interpreter, MacGambit, and began working through the book, writing
shims as needed for MIT Scheme constructs.

Later in the book, I switched to using a Dylan implementation, in its
original Lisp-style S-expression syntax before Dylan officially
switched to an Algol-style infix syntax!
