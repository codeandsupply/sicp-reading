# My notes: Preface to second edition

## My comment

The second edition was published in 1996, twelve years after
the 1984 first edition.

## Changes

They rewrote the Scheme code to conform to the IEEE 1990
standard. Good, I had trouble with the 1984 edition because it used
weird stuff from MIT Scheme.

Uh, note that `www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicp` is a dead link now,
in 2015. How the Web works. The proper link now is
[`https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/`](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).
